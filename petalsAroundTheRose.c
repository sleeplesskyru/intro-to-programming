===========
"Petals Around the Rose" is a puzzle game played with dice. This code will randomly generate 5 numbers (roll the dice) and will ask you for an answer to the puzzle.

The Rules: The key to the formula is given by the name of the puzzle, and the presenter should state the name of the challenge distinctly. The calculated (announced) result for a throw is calculated by counting only the "petals around the rose", where a "rose" is any die face with a center dot. On a standard 6-sided die, this corresponds to the three odd facesâ€”1, 3, and 5. The rose's "petals" are the dots which surround the center dot. There is no rose on the 2, 4, or 6 faces, so these count as zero. There are no petals on the 1 face, so it also counts as zero. There are two petals and four petals on the 3 and 5 faces, respectively. Thus, the solution to a given throw can be found by:

Adding the total petals, or;
Starting with 2 times the number of dice that land on the 3 face and adding to it 4 times the number of dice that lands on the 5 face.
For example, in a roll of 1-2-3-4-5-6, there is one 3 and one 5 face, so the result is two plus four, or six.
